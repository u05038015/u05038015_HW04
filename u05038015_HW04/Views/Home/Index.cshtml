                <h2>Goal 14: Life Below Water</h2> <br />
                <p>
                    The oceans cover more than 70 per cent of the surface of our planet and play a key role in supporting life on earth. They are the most diverse and important ecosystem, contributing to global and regional elemental cycling, and regulating the climate. The ocean provides natural resources including food, materials, substances, and energy.
                    Marine Protected Areas contribute to poverty reduction by increasing fish catches and income, creating new jobs, improving health, and empowering women. Increasing levels of debris in the world’s seas and oceans is having a major and growing economic impact.
                    Oceans, seas and other marine resources are essential to human well-being and social and economic development worldwide. Their conservation and sustainable use are central to achieving the 2030 Agenda, especially for small island developing States. Marine resources are particularly important for people living in coastal communities, who represented 37 per cent of the world's population in 2010. Oceans provide livelihoods, subsistence and benefits from fisheries, tourism and other sectors. They also help regulate the global ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. However, oceans and coastal areas are extremely vulnerable to environmental degradation, overfishing, climate change and pollution.
                    UNEP is working to develop a coherent approach to measuring the ocean condition and the drivers, pressures, impacts and responses. This is through promoting the measurement of the ocean SDGs where UNEP is the custodian and through working to develop an approach for better ocean accounts.
                    UNEP published a Global Manual on SDG 14.1.1, 14.2.1 and 14.5.1. This manual also provides details related to how the SDGs align with the Regional Seas.

                <h2>Goals of Life Below Water:</h2> <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution</li>
                    <li>By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in order to achieve healthy and productive oceans</li>
                    <li>Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation at all levels</li>
                    <li>By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics</li>
                    <li>By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international law and based on the best available scientific information</li>
                    <li>By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation</li>
                    <li>By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism</li>
                    <li>Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing States and least developed countries</li>
                    <li> Provide access for small-scale artisanal fishers to marine resources and markets</li>
                    <li>Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing international law as reflected in United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of "The future we want"</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Why did I choose life below water:</h2> <br />
                <p>
                    Plastic is busy consuming the ocean. Plastic is designed to last which is a blessing and a curse. Over 150 million tonnes of plastics in the ocean. The ocean has more plastic than fish left in the ocean. <br />
                    Dead zones are created where oxygen levels are low. Marine life will not survive in those areas and the ecosystems collapse. 415 dead zones have been identified worldwide. <br />
                    Humans created the mess and it is our responsiblity to try and fix it. Not fixing the problem means that we will kill our oceans and another food source, jobs will be lost.
